# How to Play Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a timeless single-player puzzle game that combines strategy with a touch of luck.

## Board

The game board is a grid of squares. Each square on the board may or may not conceal a mine.

## Game Mechanics

Each time you reveal a square, the game decides what happens next:

- You stepped on a mine! The game ends.
- There is at least one mine somewhere around it. The square displays the total number of mines in the neighboring squares to help you plan your next move.
- There are no mines nearby. The square is empty, and all its neighboring squares are automatically revealed in a chain reaction.

You win the game by revealing all safe squares without stepping on a mine.

### First Move

The first square you reveal is always a safe, empty square.

### Flags

To help you keep track of potential mine locations, you can:

- Flag a square if you are certain it contains a mine.
- Place a question mark if you suspect it might be mined but aren't sure.

Squares marked with a flag or a question mark cannot be revealed until the marker is removed.

### Mine Counter

At the start of a game, the mine counter displays the total count of concealed mines. Each time you flag a square, that counter is decreased by one unit.

## Game Controls

### Basic Controls (Hidden Squares)

1. **Single Tap or Left Click**: Reveal the square.
2. **Short Press or Right Click**: Place or remove a flag.
3. **Long Press or Middle Click**: Place or remove a question mark.

### Advanced Controls (Revealed Squares)

1. **Single Tap or Left Click**: Automatically reveal neighboring squares when the number of flagged squares matches the square's mine count.
2. **Short Press or Right Click**: Automatically flag neighboring squares when the number of hidden squares matches the square's mine count.

## Tips for Beginners

1. Start in a corner or an edge to minimize initial risk.
2. Use the numbers on revealed squares to logically deduce where mines are.
3. Don't guess unless you absolutely must. Take your time to analyze the board.

Minesweeper is a game of patience and strategy. The more you play, the better you'll become at spotting patterns and avoiding mines.

Enjoy the challenge and have fun playing Minesweeper!
