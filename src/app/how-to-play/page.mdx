# How to Play Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a timeless single-player puzzle game that combines strategy with a touch of luck. Ready to become a minesweeping pro? Let's dive in!

## Goal

Your mission: uncover all the safe squares on the board to win. But beware—some squares hide sneaky mines. Step on one, and it's game over. Let's stay sharp and avoid those mines, shall we?

## Key Concepts

- **Square**: A piece of the board that can either be safe or hiding a mine.
- **Surroundings**: All the squares directly around a square (including diagonals).

## How It Works

When you reveal a square, one of four things happens:

- **You hit a mine**: Boom! Game over.
- **You reveal a safe square**:
  - **Victory!** If it's the last safe square, you win the game. Cheers!
  - **Mine alert!** The square shows the number of mines in its surroundings to help you decide your next move.
  - **Clear area**: If there are no nearby mines, the square is empty, and the game automatically reveals all its surroundings.

### First Move

Good news—your first revealed square is always safe and empty. Phew!

### Flags

If you think a square has a mine, you can mark it with a flag. Not sure? Add a question mark instead. Don't worry—flagged or marked squares can't be revealed by accident.

### Mine Counter

The mine counter at the start of the game shows the total number of hidden mines. Each time you place a flag, the counter decreases. Use it to track your progress!

## Game Controls

### Basic Actions (for hidden squares)

1. **Single Tap or Left Click**: Reveal the square.
2. **Short Press or Right Click**: Place or remove a flag.
3. **Long Press or Middle Click**: Place or remove a question mark.

### Advanced Actions (for revealed squares)

1. **Single Tap or Left Click**: Automatically reveal surrounding squares when the number of nearby flags matches the square's mine count.
2. **Short Press or Right Click**: When the number of hidden surrounding squares matches the square's mine count, automatically flag them.

## Tips for Success

- Take your time and think carefully about each move.
- Use flags and question marks to keep track of potential mines.
- Pay close attention to the numbers—they're your best clue to stay safe.

Now you're ready to sweep mines like a pro. Good luck and have fun!
